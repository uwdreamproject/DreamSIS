=begin
Coordinates the automated submission, retrieval and processing of data with the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC). The NSC contains enrollment and graduation records for nearly every college in the country. Outreach programs and schools can submit batch queries to the clearinghouse via SFTP to monitor the postsecondary outcomes of their students.

Relevant attributes on Customer:
* clearinghouse_customer_number
* clearinghouse_contract_start_date
* clearinghouse_number_of_submissions_per_year

==Customer account setup==
1. Customer inputs NSC customer ID number and SFTP password in Customer#edit.
2. Encrypt the customer ID and password using private key stored outside of version control. Do not store in ChangeLog.
3. Track the number of submissions per year allowed, as well as the annual start date for the contract.
